# Lab Report 4 | VIM
## Andrew Jeter | June 5, 2023 | CSE15L Politz, J.
  
For this lab report, I will be detailing the steps to the `vim` challenge in Lab 7. As we all know, `vim` is a very powerful yet quite controversial programming language, but after learning the basics and using it for the Skill Demonstration 2 practice, it actually proved itself very handy in my `ssh` `ieng6` login, where I didn't have access to anything but the command line in Visual Studio Code. A handy tool called `vimtutor` showed me the ropes, and it is very helpful at teaching you how to navigate such a daunting interface. Anyways, here is a fun little reminder of the many joys of Vim, although if this is your first time using Vim, please don't worry :)

### Timing Tasks!
We will use this repository for the purposes of these tasks: [https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7](https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-s23/lab7)


1. **Setup** Delete any existing forks of the repository I have on my account
2. **Setup** Fork the repository
3. **Start the Timer!**
4. Log into `ieng6`
  - To get to this step, you just need to type `ssh cs15lsp23__@ieng6.ucsd.edu` into the command line, and if you don't have an `ssh key` on your local system, then just enter your password as well.
6. Clone my fork of the repository from my Github account
7. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
8. Edit the code file `ListExamples.java` to fix the failing test (the error is that `index1` is used instead of `index2` in the final loop in `merge`
9. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
10. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account

After you've completed steps 1-3 on your own, follow along with me as I guide us through the rest!
