# Lab Report 4 | VIM
## Andrew Jeter | June 5, 2023 | CSE15L Politz, J.
  
For this lab report, I will be detailing the steps to the `vim` challenge in Lab 7. As we all know, `vim` is a very powerful yet quite controversial programming language, but after learning the basics and using it for the Skill Demonstration 2 practice, it actually proved itself very handy in my `ssh` `ieng6` login, where I didn't have access to anything but the command line in Visual Studio Code. A handy tool called `vimtutor` showed me the ropes, and it is very helpful at teaching you how to navigate such a daunting interface. Anyways, here is a fun little reminder of the many joys of Vim, although if this is your first time using Vim, please don't worry :)
