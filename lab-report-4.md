# Lab Report 4 | VIM
## Andrew Jeter | June 5, 2023 | CSE15L Politz, J.
  
For this lab report, I will be detailing the steps to the `vim` challenge in Lab 7. As we all know, `vim` is a very powerful yet quite controversial programming language, but after learning the basics and using it for the Skill Demonstration 2 practice, it actually proved itself very handy in my `ssh` `ieng6` login, where I didn't have access to anything but the command line in Visual Studio Code. A handy tool called `vimtutor` showed me the ropes, and it is very helpful at teaching you how to navigate such a daunting interface. Anyways, here is a fun little reminder of the many joys of Vim, although if this is your first time using Vim, please don't worry :)

### Timing Tasks!

1. **Setup** Delete any existing forks of the repository I have on my account
2. **Setup** Fork the repository
3. **Start the Timer!**
4. Log into `ieng6`
5. Clone my fork of the repository from my Github account
6. Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
7. Edit the code file `ListExamples.java` to fix the failing test (the error is that `index1` is used instead of `index2` in the final loop in `merge`
8. Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
9. Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account

After you've completed steps 1-3 on your own, follow along with me as I guide us through the rest!
