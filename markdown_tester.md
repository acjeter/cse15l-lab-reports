*I'm* using **`Horizontal Rule`** to make this long horizontal line above.

# For example, this is an example of `Header 1`
## And this is `Header 2`, which is similar but not the same.

1. First line of list
2. Not the third line of this list
3. Third line of list
4. Not the fifth line of this list

* How can you make an
* effective presentation
* Without bullet points

*btw that was a really amazing haiku...*

Here's a link to my favorite color `Cerulean`

Here's a random code block that I just wrote:
```
class RandomTest {
  int basicX;
  int basicY;
  
  RandomTest(int basicX, int basicY) {
    this.basicX = basicX;
    this.basicY = basicY;
  }
}
```
