# Lab Report 2 | Servers and Bugs
## Andrew Jeter | April 22, 2023 | CSE 15L Politz, J.

Welcome back CSE15L students! I know what it has been only a few weeks since the last post, but I am excited for what we will be talking about today! I'm confident that if you did well during the first tutorial you'll do even better on this one! We will be writing a web server called `StringServer` that supports the specified path and behavior that I will describe below. The web server that we develop will be able to keep track of a string that gets added to by incoming url requests.

## Part 1: StringServer

The specific request that the web server will handle is:

`/add-message?s=<string>`

This url request will concatenate a new line (`\n`) and the string given after the `=` in the query to the running string in the web server, and the server will then output the entire sting so far.

For example, after

`/add-message?=Hi!`

The page should display

> `Hi!`

and after

`/add-message?s=How are you doing today?`

the page should show

> `Hi!`
> 
> `How are you doing today?`

When writing this web server, it is important to note the criterion of the writeup. Here, you will need to create `runningString`, a passive variable of type `String` that will be added to. This is because the web server needs to be able to handle multiple requests, and they are to be concatenated together on new lines for each string given through a new request. The implemented code for `StringServer` will look like this.

**IMPORTANT**
Something that I *painfully* discovered while working on this lab report for two weeks, I was having duplication issues on the web server on `Safari`. I came to realize that I was having issues _because_ I was using `Safari`. I guess it was random, but I'm not really sure. All I know is that it **works on `Google Chrome`**. So for the purposes of my writing below, I was using the `Google Chrome` browser.

When using the `/add-message?s=Hello` url request, here is what the web server should do:

![image](StrServ2.png)

In this screenshot, `handleRequest` is called to actually *do* something with the url inputted. This depends on the path inputted, and depending on this, the `query` inputted. For this screenshot, `Hello` is part of the query after the `?s=`. The relevent fields include `runningString`, `port`, `URI`, `urlStrings`, and `query. 

For this screenshot:

1. `int port = 4092`
2. `URI url = http://localhost:4092/add-message?s=Hello`
3. `String runningString = "Hello + \n"`
4. `String query = s=Hello`
5. `String[] urlStrings = {s=, Hello}`


Originally, the value of port is null, the value of `runningString` is an empty string, the value of `query` is an empty string, and the value of `urlStrings` is an empty string. The changes of the relevant fields of the class are made when you input the one string in the query of the `/add-message?s=<string>` request, which triggers the if statement to update the `runningString`.

***

When using the `/add-message?s=How are you?` url request, here is what the web server should do:

![image](StrServ3.png)

In this screenshot, `handleRequest` is again called to handle the request. This url request has `path /add-message` and `query ?s=How are you?`. This means that runningString will need to be updated, along with other values for the fields mentioned below.

1. `int port = 4092` (Port remains the same since there isn't a new server started.)
2. `URI url = http://localhost:4092/add-message?s=How are you?`
3. `String runningString = "Hello + \n + How are you? + \n"`
4. `String query = s=How are you?`
5. `String[] urlStrings = {s=, Hello}`


Before this request the values of the fields above were as I stated in the outline of the previous screenshot.

## Part 2: Bugs
Lab 3 had oddly, lots of üêõ's! Through working with my lab group on the bug fixing, I learned that even if some of the most important parts of the code are working, it is **extremely** important to test _all_ of your code thoroughly! Think about the context: you are developing a security system software for a hostpital's medical files. You **have** to make sure that the code has no possible way to break into the personal medical data, otherwise confidential patient information could get spread into the public! This is not only scary, but _illegal_.

Therefore, I will walkthrough information for one of the bugs from Lab 3 here.
